UtilityCSS
============
A no JS, no bullsh\*t StyleSheet. Just tiny tools to get you going.
I put together a set of interesting utilities that can be used while creating a website. Just with pure CSS, and compatible with most frameworks around.
All the tools used have liks to the original project, which in some cases, is way more complete than this. I just used some snippets that may be of interest. No "beautifying", no nothing. Just tools.


Example usage:
============
You can read the documentation [here](http://fgarci03.github.io/utilitycss/)


Roadmap:
============
The only goal to this sylesheet is to provide a simple and light set of tools to use on any project. Anything can evolve from there.
There are, although, some features I'm thinking about implementing:
+ Some simple menus (fixed, static, etc);
+ Displace elements on different lines on command (just like Bootstrap).


Contributing:
============
Testing each feature alone or together with other frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc) is already awesome. Found a bug? Even better!
Managed to solve it? Wow, let me have your kids! A NEW FEATURE? **OH-MY-GOD!!!**

Just send me the code!
