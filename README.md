UtilityCSS
============
A no JS, no bullsh*t StyleSheet. Just tiny tools to get you going.
I put together a set of interesting utilities that can be used while creating a website. Just with pure CSS, and compatible with most frameworks around.
All the tools used have liks to the original project, which in some cases, is way more complete than this. I just used some snippets that may be of interest. No "beautifying", no nothing. Just tools.


Utilities:
============
**Video Wrapper** - *Fluid/Responsive video container*: http://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php

**Code Highlighter**- *Highlight your code with a tiny library*: http://github.com/fgarci03/highlightcss

**Ungrid** - *Responsive, table-based CSS grid system*: http://chrisnager.github.io/ungrid/

**SimpleCSS** - *Bare-boned responsive CSS "framework"*: https://github.com/neculaesei/simplecss (only a few features from it)


Example usage:
============
You can either load the entire stylesheet, or get snippets from it and have it even lighter!
Untill the code is properly tested and finished (at least what's here now working 100%), read the documentation on the original creators. I will later provide a full set of instructions for each utility.


Roadmap:
============
The only goal to this sylesheet is to provide a simple and light set of tools to use on any project. Anything can evolve from there


Contributing:
============
Testing each feature alone or together with other frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc) is already awesome. Found a bug? Even better!
Managed to solve it? Wow, let me have your kids!

Just send me the code!
