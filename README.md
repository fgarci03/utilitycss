UtilityCSS
============
A no JS, no bullsh\*t StyleSheet. Just tiny tools to get you going.
I put together a set of interesting utilities that can be used while creating a website. Just with pure CSS, and compatible with most frameworks around.
All the tools used have liks to the original project, which in some cases, is way more complete than this. I just used some snippets that may be of interest. No "beautifying", no nothing. Just tools.


Example usage:
============
You can read the documentation [here](https://fgarci03.github.io/utilitycss/)


Roadmap:
============
The stylesheet is currently being ported to SASS. I'm still to young at it, so I'm taking my time to do it. It is perfectly usable though, the SCSS files aren't yet on the desired format. You are very welcome to help me building a beautifull .scss that produces a clean CSS output! (I'm also having some trouble using SASS to minify the .css file... Still haven't figured out what exactly.)
The only goal to this sylesheet is to provide a simple and light set of tools to use on any project. Anything can evolve from there.
There are, although, some features I'm thinking about implementing:
+ Some simple menus (fixed, static, etc);
+ Displace elements on different lines on command (just like Bootstrap).


Contributing:
============
Testing each feature alone or together with other frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc) is already awesome. Found a bug? Even better!
Managed to solve it? Wow, let me have your kids! A NEW FEATURE? **OH-MY-GOD!!!**

Just send me the code!
